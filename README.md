Mzllah Coffee and Artisan Roastery Mobile App v1.1.2

Features:

Loyalty program is a standard loyalty system with regards to accumulating and redeeming points. The unique element to the loyalty program is what clients can redeem. We will sty away from the standard “free coffee” module but rather giveaway courses, coffee beans, brew equipment, etc

Coffee Journal & Brew calculator is an incentive for people to keep the app even if they are not a frequent customer of Mzllah. For any person who has an interested in specialty coffee (essentially our entire target market) this app will serve as a journal for their coffee discoveries and an essential tool. This part of the app will also help largely in word-of-mouth marketing withing the community we would like to know about us - specialty coffee curious individuals. In this instance it is a case of “get the app for the coffee journal, find out about Mzllah”. 


Below is the general flow, in order, of the app currently. As discussed in future we would elaborate and expand on some functions.

The 2nd button is to redeem points, this opens a menu of redeemable items. To redeem an item the customer needs to scan a qr code same as with earning points.

So for example if someone has 300 points available but have already spent 500 points in the past then their membership level points will be 800) Membership levels will be broken down as follows:
